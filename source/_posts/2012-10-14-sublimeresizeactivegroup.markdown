I developed a little Sublime plugin that automatically resizes the active layout group to use up the most space. You can find [SublimeResizeActiveGroup](https://github.com/FunkMonkey/SublimeResizeActiveGroup) on github.

> Sublime Plugin for resizing the active layout group when the user switches groups. Resize the groups once as usual using the sliders. Whenever you activate a different group now, the selected group will be resized to have the most space.
