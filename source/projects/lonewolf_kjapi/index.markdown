In September 2008, I started working as an intern at [Ksatria Gameworks](http://www.ksatria.com) for 6 months.

Ksatria is an independent game developer based in **Singapore**, employing a multi-cultural team coming from all around the world.  
I joined the group of programmers, headed by co-founder [Cedric Caillaud](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/cedric-caillaud/2/aa4/828).

At the time being, I have been working on Ksatria's current project **LoneWolf** and **kjAPI**, the engine it is based on.

##LoneWolf - Flight from the Dark

{% img right images/lonewolf.jpg %}
**LoneWolf - Flight from the Dark** is based on the first volume of Joe Dever's game book series *LoneWolf*.  
It is about a warrior monk of the order of the Kai, who lives in the fantasy world of Magnamund. 
As his monastery is destroyed by the Giaks, he - as the only survivor and last of the Kai - tries to 
travel to the capital to warn the king.

A classical story about good versus evil.

##kjAPI

{% img right images/kjapi.jpg %}
Besides developing *LoneWolf*, [kjAPI](http://www.kjapi.com) is considered as a product itself. 

The engine was built in a very flexible way from the beginning to create a middleware product for game-developers - just like the Unreal or Id-Tech engines.

##Tasks

This is an excerpt of what I have done at Ksatria:

- Refactoring, rewriting and documenting the GUI system to a large amount
- Extending the GUI tools, as well as enhancing their usability
- Creation of game GUI's and scripts (menus, HUD, radial weapon chooser)
- Animation compression
- Gameplay programming
- The usual suspects: fixing bugs, crashes and memory leaks wherever they appear
